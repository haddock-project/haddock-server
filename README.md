# Troubleshooting
## Common issues
### Making a request to /api/app return me an error
If your error is Ã `Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock [...] permission denied`

Haddock failed to access the docker deamon socket, verify that docker is installed or try running go as `sudo` <br/><br/>
It can also happen because the docker socket path is different in your environment, please submit an issue ^^
